Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect
============================

    This module provides an RPC::ExtDirect gateway implementation for Plack
    environment. It is packaged as a standard Plack middleware component
    suitable for using with Plack::Builder.

    Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect is recommended to be used with Perl
    versions 5.12 and newer, for reasons explained below. For Perls older
    than 5.12, CGI::ExtDirect gateway may be a better choice - especially if
    you cannot install XS dependent packages.

    If you are not familiar with Ext.Direct, more information can be found
    in RPC::ExtDirect::Intro.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test
        make install

EXAMPLES

    See included Ext JS examples for ideas on what Ext.Direct is and how to
    use it in Plack applications. The examples are not installed along with
    the Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect module, and are only available in the
    `examples/' directory of the CPAN distribution.

    To run examples type the following in the Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect
    tarball directory (for Perl 5.12 and newer):

        cd examples
        plackup app.psgi

    If you are using Perl 5.8.x or 5.10.x, type the following instead:

        cd examples
        perl plackup_oldperl app.psgi

    Note that the examples do not require Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect to be
    installed so you can try them beforehand. That said, this module depends
    on RPC::ExtDirect being available in `@INC' so if you don't want to
    install either module, unpack both RPC::ExtDirect and
    Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect tarballs to the same directory and use
    `$PERL5LIB' to point to RPC::ExtDirect location:

        cd examples
        PERL5LIB=../../RPC-ExtDirect-3.xx/lib perl plackup_oldperl app.psgi
