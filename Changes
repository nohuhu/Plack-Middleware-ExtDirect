Revision history for Perl extension Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect.

1.02  Sat Oct  1 20:55:27 2011
    - Turned on debugging in examples/app.psgi; since exception
      handling works properly now, there's no sense in turning
      it off anymore.

      Updated examples.pl to include fresh-built module
      Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect so that examples could be
      tried without installing the module.

      Bumped required RPC::ExtDirect version to 1.10.

1.01  Fri Sep 30 10:22:33 2011
    - Minor changes to documentation.
    - Made sure ExtJS examples are clearly marked
      as being (c) Sencha Inc.

1.00  Thu Sep 29 18:27:55 2011
